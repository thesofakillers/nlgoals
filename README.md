# Natural Language for Goal Misgeneralization

## Requirements and Setup

Details such as python and package versions can be found in the generated
[pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) and [poetry.lock](poetry.lock) files.

We recommend using an environment manager such as
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). After setting up your environment
with the correct python version, please proceed with the installation of the
required packages

For [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) users, getting setup is as easy as
running

```terminal
poetry install
```

We also provide a `requirements.txt` files for
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) users who do not wish to use poetry. We
provide a [requirements-minimal.txt](requirements/requirements-minimal.txt) file
and a [requirements-complete.txt](requirements/requirements-complete.txt) file
in the [requirements](requirements/) directory. We recommend simply running

```terminal
pip install -r requirements/requirements-complete}.txt
```

These `requirements.txt` file are generated by running
[gen_pip_reqs.sh](gen_pip_reqs.sh)

The project structure is largely based on the
[cookiecutter data-science template](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science).
This is purposely opinionated so that paths align over collaborators without
having to edit config files. Users may find the
[cookiecutter data-science opinions page](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#opinions),
of relevance

The top level `data/` and `models/` directory are in version control only to
show structure. Their contents will not be committed and are ignored via
`.gitignore`.
